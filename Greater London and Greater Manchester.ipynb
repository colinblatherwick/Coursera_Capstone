HS2 (High Speed 2) rail and HS3 are aiming to provide greater capacity and faster connections between the UK\u2019s capital city London, other major cities such as Birmingham and Manchester, regional cities e.g. Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield etc. A potential connection to Edinburgh and Glasgow at a future date has been mooted. There is evidence this will provide significant investment and gains in productivity to both the regional economies and London, albeit in two to three decades.\n\nThe regional economies are naturally rebalancing as the industrial heartlands of the Midlands and Northern England reinvent themselves with higher value industrial (automotive, aerospace pharmaceuticals) and services (media, game development, legal and financial services). There has been a significant increase in businesses \u2018north-shoring\u2019 or moving HQ\u2019s to other major cities for cost reasons. \nOn the other hand, London is facing issues of its own with costs outpacing income. Many of the city\u2019s residents have begun to question the feasibility of locating there, as have many economists. Despite higher median wages, net tax, the cost of living combined with higher house prices has eroded the disposable income and quality of life of Londoners(1).\n\nThere is evidence that such costs and centralisation have crowded out innovation both in London and in the regions(2). London as the capital is the largest economy, but it need not be the only location for higher value-added employment(3) \nRebalancing could lead to better outcomes for both the regions and London with greater investment and opportunities in the regions and a reduction of cost pressures that would benefit London\u2019s innovative service-oriented economy.\n\nThis has increased interest in analyses of the costs of living and business as well as the comparative attractiveness of neighbourhoods in London and alternative cities to private individuals looking to relocate in both directions. \nThe objective of this project is to investigate and compare median incomes, house prices and neighbourhoods for two metropolitan areas (London and Manchester) in the UK.\nOnly neighbourhoods at or below the London median income in the data (\u00a331,500) will be considered.\n\n## Core Problem\n\nWhilst government statisticians, decision makers and business have the means to use and understand data to draw inference most private individuals do not. Therefore, this project will seek to collate the required information, analyse, and present the data is a way that is simple to understand. It will also serve as base from which to draw further detailed analysis into the components.\nUltimately the objective of this project is about enabling private individuals to assess the attractiveness of two cities given their personal circumstances utilising a data centric approach.   This is not about which one is \u2018better\u2019, appealing to emotions or regional loyalties.\nInterest\n\nThe government, businesses and individuals alike require insights on how best to proceed with investment and employment decisions as both the regional economies and London transform with their various pros and cons. When deciding on a location private individual need to take account earning potential, taxes, housing costs, general cost of living and the surrounding neighbourhood.\n\n## Data Requirements \n\nThe two metropolitan areas that will be covered in this analysis will be Greater London and Greater Manchester, but this could equally apply to Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield etc. The data for the neighbourhoods will be scraped of their respective Wikipedia pages:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_in_Greater_Manchester. GeoPy will be utilised to gather the Latitude and Longitude of the respective neighborhoods.\n\nForeSquare will be used to retrieve information on the types of venues present in each neighbourhood. A K-Means cluster algorithm from scikit will determine the clusters based on the frequency of types of venues in each neighbourhood. The clusters will be presented as basis of comparison to viewers.\nWe will use data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) for data on median earning and house prices whilst we will use websites such as https://listentotaxman.com/ and https://www.rightmove.co.uk/ will be used to calculate net tax income and housing costs based on the data provided by the ONS. Housing costs will be calculated as the mortgage cost with a 20% down payment.\n\nThere will subsequently be manual calculations and adjustments to errors in data where it is more efficient to exercise in Excel. In this instance data frames will be saved, downloaded, edited and reuploaded. Such manual calculations and adjustment include coordinates, and formulas for calculating net tax and disposable income.\nThe data will be output in the form of a map in folium showing the geolocation of the neighbourhoods in Manchester and London as well a list of their respective cluster features. Additionally, bar charts displaying median, net tax and disposable income as well as a choropleth of house prices will be displayed to allow the viewer to quickly identify and compare neighbourhoods.\n\n## Extended Background\n\nReinvention is a chicken and egg problem (4) Three hundred years of centralisation has concentrated the majority of global businesses and national companies in London and the south east in a manner similar to France and South Korea as opposed to regionalism in Germany, Spain, Italy and the USA. This reinvention will require government, businesses, and people to invest, relocate, and understand current and future opportunities and problems. \nImproving communications technology has provided the potential for labour mobility on a virtual foundation by removing location as a factor. Unfortunately, this potential had not been explored prior to COVID-19.\n\n(1) Despite a large concentration of global business, high income jobs and diversity London also has the high levels of socioeconomic inequality and it is questionable whether for a given quartile Londoners are better off all things equal.\n\n(2) This has raised the question of whether the UK, even London, may be more productive when regions are on a more even base. The theory is that increasing productivity in the regional economies does not have to come at the expense of London but can add to it; it may however require some priority initial investment.\n\n(3) Bavaria, Germany has a larger economy than Hesse but the per capita (productivity and thus wages) is the same. GVA (Goods Value Added) has been a subject of company location and not innate productivity. This does not suggest that agglomeration incentives do not factor in company location decisions but merely that agglomeration is not a direct cause of productivity improvements.\n\n(4) The origins of Silicon Valley owe to fortuitous events. William Shockley\u2019s family connections to California, his work at Bell Labs on radar and a subsequent requirement to replace fragile vacuum technology and the opportunities for the field present in California (after massive government investment due only to its location vis a visa Japan and subsequent future outlays for Korea, Vietnam etc.)"
